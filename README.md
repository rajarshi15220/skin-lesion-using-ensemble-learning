Deep Ensemble Learning for Skin Lesion Classification

Skin cancer many death every year globally. If it is diagnosed in early stage it is curable
. Auto classification of the different skin lesion is a tough task to provide clinicians with the ability to differentiate between all different kind of lesion categories and recommend the best and the suitable treatment. This project focuses on the identification of this disease using ensemble learning of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Since our framework is realized within a single neural net architecture, all the parameters of the member CNNs and the weights applied in the fusion can be determined by backpropagation routinely applied for such tasks
Our main aim is to develop such an automated framework that efficiently performs a reliable automatic lesion classification to seven skin lesion types. In this task, we propose a deep neural network based framework which follows an ensemble approach with the help of pre trained neural network.
